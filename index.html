	<!-- <p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Jonathan McGlone</span> and I make things on the web for academic libraries and scholarly publishers.</p> -->

	<p>I'm a <span itemprop="title">Consultant</span> 
		at <a href="https://www.intertek.com/energy-water/">Intertek Energy & Water Consultancy Services</a>,
		working on a variety of projects and providing environmental assessment for clients.
		Before working at Intertek, I was a PhD student studying in the area of coastal engineering at 
		<a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/research/explore/research-units/hydro-environmental-research-centre">Hydro-environmental Research Centre (HRC)</a>, 
		<a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/">Cardiff University</a>. 
		My PhD research was supervised by Dr <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/364315-ahmadian-reza">Reza Ahmadian</a> 
		and Prof <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/364367-falconer-roger">Roger Falconer</a>. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I have undertaken both my BEng and MEng studies in coastal and offshore engineering, which adequately 
		trained me with solid foundations in mathematics, programming, hydro-environmental and 
		ecological knowledge of coastal, estuarine and river waters, etc.
