	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	<p>
		Tidal energy has a significant advantage over many other forms of renewable energy because of the predictability of
		tides. Tidal Range Structures (TRSs) are one of the main forms of tidal renewable energy. Designing the operation of
		TRSs is one of the challenging aspects in early stages due to the large variety of scenarios. Traditionally this has been
		done using a grid search. However, grid search can be very elaborate and time consuming during the design of TRSs.
		This paper proposes a novel and more efficient method to optimise the design of the operation of TRSs by maximising
		their electricity generation using a Genetic Algorithm. This GA model is coupled with a 0-D model which breaks the
		tides into small units and considers flexible operation. This approach delivered more than a 10% increase in electricity
		generation when compared to non-flexible operation, i.e. using fixed heads for all tides, just by optimising the
		operation. The GA model was able to achieve the same amount of electricity compared to the best grid search method
		with flexible operation more efficiently, i.e. with about a 50% reduction in simulation time. The feasibility of the elite
		operational scheme is validated through a developed 2-D model.
