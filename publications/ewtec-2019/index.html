	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	<p>
		This paper focused on facilitating the
		development of Tidal Range Structures (TRSs) including
		tidal lagoons by using an improved Genetic Algorithm (GA)
		model instead of common Grid Search (GS) method which
		has traditionally been used for the optimisation of
		operation schemes. The GA model splits the operation into
		single tidal cycle and optimise the operation of TRSs
		through the process of mutation, recombination and
		selection, which create the new schemes. The GA model
		which takes the 0-D approach as the fitness function was
		established and developed with different recombination
		methods, to reveal an enhanced efficiency of the GA with a
		ring structure recombination method. With a proposed case
		study of tidal lagoons, the optimised operational scheme
		using the GA was in consist with the GS method, with an
		approximately 10% increase of the electricity generation,
		comparing to the fixed head schedule. However, better
		convergence can be obtained with the application of the GA
		than the GS method, which proved the feasibility of
		utilising the GA model to solve the operational
		characteristics optimisation in TRSs.
