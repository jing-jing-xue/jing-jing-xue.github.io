	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	<p>
		There has been much interest in Marine Renewable
		Energy (MRE) schemes in the past decade, and across much of the
		globe, due to increasing interest in reducing CO 2 emissions and
		capturing the vast untapped resources of MRE. There have been
		several proposals to build a number of Tidal Range Schemes
		(TRSs), such as tidal lagoons and barrages, around the UK, and
		globally. It is estimated that the tidal range resource in the UK will
		be between 25 and 30 GW [1] and the independent Hendry Review
		commissioned by the UK government recommended construction
		of the world’s first tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay, in the South West
		of the UK, in January 2017. One of the potential disadvantages of
		TRSs is their high capital cost, which consequently can lead to a
		high cost of electricity generation. However, TRSs have a
		significant advantage over many other forms of renewable energy
		generation in that they are based on a resource that is highly
		predictable. The predictability of TRSs provide us with the
		potential of active planning and optimising the operation of such
		schemes, which is not possible with less predictable sources.
		Optimisation of the operation could potentially result in higher
		electricity generation and lower hydro-environmental impacts
		and therefore lower electricity costs which therefore could lead to
		further schemes becoming economically viable. This study
		investigates the optimisation of TRSs and their operation by
		considering a number of structural variables, such as the number
		and capacity of the turbines and the area of sluice gates, besides a
		number of operational factors, including generation schemes and
		generation and sluicing opening and closing head differences. The
		hydro-environmental impacts of these scenarios are also
		considered to avoid significant adverse impacts of the optimised
		schemes.
